MineStars is a game server engine, with special capabilities, as:
- Multiple servers support
- Multithreaded Lua (Sandboxed, but with free usage)
- Server Creator Engine (SNE->SSC)

MineStars is based on the Minetest & MultiCraft project

This project MUST not be used to play like a client!

Paths
-----
Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

Depends where do you install this.

Worlds can be found as separate folders in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file
------------------
- Default location:
    `user/minestars.conf`
- This file is created by closing MultiCraft for the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `location_of_exe/../minestars.conf` and also `location_of_exe/../../minestars.conf`

Command-line options
--------------------
- Use `--help`

#### Download

You can install Git for easily keeping your copy up to date.
If you donâ€™t want Git, read below on how to get the source without Git.
This is an example for installing Git on Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install git

For Fedora users:

    sudo dnf install git

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MultiCraft/MultiCraft.git
    cd MultiCraft

Download source, without using Git:

    wget https://github.com/MultiCraft/MultiCraft/archive/main.tar.gz
    tar xf main.tar.gz
    cd MultiCraft-main

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:

    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    make -j$(nproc)

Run it:

    ./bin/multicraft

- Use `cmake . -LH` to see all CMake options and their current state.
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package),
  you will want to use `-DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE`.
- You can build a bare server by specifying `-DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE`.
- You can disable the client build by specifying `-DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE`.
- You can select between Release and Debug build by `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>`.
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger.
- If you build a bare server you don't need to have Irrlicht installed.
  - In that case use `-DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=/the/irrlicht/source`.
